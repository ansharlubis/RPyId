**6thMeeting - Monday, February 24, 2020**

This is the first trial of hackathon, thus we will call “Semi”
Hackathon. No pressure, the main point is having fun. We encourage each
participant to set your own target and let’s help each others\!

## Target

1.  Data exploratory (main target: data wrangling, ploting distribution,
    and descriptive statistic)
2.  Simple statistic inference (optional: if you interested in certain
    case)
3.  Possible analysis (what analysis is needed to get more informations
    out of the data)
4.  Short report (if time permit)

## Datasets

If you have your own dataset to solve, please come with it. If you
prefer to explore same dataset together, let’s use this [World Happiness
Report Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). Full
report can be found in the [World Happiness Report
website](https://worldhappiness.report/).

Below is the list of examples on how to explore the data, for your
inspiration.

Example of problem set for data exploration:

1.  What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and
    each of the six factors contributing to happiness?
2.  How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as
    well as the 2016 and 2017 reports?
3.  Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in
    happiness?
4.  What are the different factors that lead to happiness of a country?
5.  What similarities and differences do the countries experiencing the
    highest/lowest WHS have?
6.  Does being in a certain region \[continent\] have any correlation to
    the average score of countries?
7.  What role does the economy play in determining the happiness of a
    country?
8.  Which factor, on average, contributes most/least to happiness?

Exploring about Indonesia’s ranks or scores change between the 2015 and
2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 would be interesting. We also can
compare Indonesian’s conditions with other country(ies) of interest.

What about some other comprehensive picture? If you familiar with the

[Factfulness book](https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/), you may
now about the [Gapminder datasets](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) with
its famous buble scatterplot. Some interesting analysis can be found

Let’s discuss together about what problem set we want to dive in. Each
person can have different goals.

## Hackathon format

We will start the hackhaton with the introductions about datasets and
what problem we want to solve/learn. If you bring your own datasets,
please introduce it as well. In the end of the day, we hopefully can
conclude our today’s session with the short notes from each of
participant and evaluate about should we do this kind of activity again?

**Schedule at glance**:

**11.00-11.45 Data introduction, listing Problem to solve, notes on R
markdown**

Here, we will get to know abut the data and build the problem to solve.
If you bring your own datasets, please introduce it as well. For those
who want to make notes in R markdown, there will be brief explanation
about that. You can also use jupyter notebook for taking the notes. Both
R markdown and Jupyter notebook will let you create your notes with the
code embeded on that.

**11.45-12.45 Break (ISHOMA, let’s buy pizza or any suggestion?)**

Prayer and lunch time.

**12.45-14.30 Hack Hack\!**

Get’s your hands (and laptop) ready for data exploration. Raise your
hand or discuss with friend if you get some problem. Roles: If you can’t
move on within 10 minutes with your code, it’s time to ask for help.

**14.30-15.00 Checkpoint 1 (discussion)**

How’s the coding going? Have you reach 50% of your target? What’s
interesting thing you have learn or find? Do you have hard time in this
practice?

<<<<<<< HEAD
**15.00-15.30 Break**

Prayer time and probably you need coffee at this point (or short nap?)

**15.30-17.00 Hack Hack\!**

**15.30-17.00 Hack Hack\! **
>>>>>>> 0f87a7ad5b12e888a9590a7c9d137c53f4a884f5

Continue\! Remember the roles: If you can’t move on within 10 minutes
with your code, it’s time to ask for help.

**17.00-17.30 Checkpoint 2 (discussion + conclusion)**

What some interesting things you’ve learn? Do you get interesting
informations from the data? Have you reach the targets?

**17.30-18.00 Evaluation, Impression, Where should we go from this?**

How’s the day? Is it fun? too difficult? Challenging? Should we do this
kind of activity again Please share your notes on our github or other
platform. Or someone probably want to write article about this?

**18.00- End of Hackhaton, let’s have dinner together\!**

## Notes of the activity
