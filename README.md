The repository containts the collections of notes, summary, and other materials from each of RPyId's meeting.
It is a twice a month meeting organized for local Indonesian community in Tokyo Institute of Technology to learn together about how to use *R* and/or *Python* for translating the experimental data.
Most of introductory parts are inspired by lectures from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
For advance participants, we can suggest implementations on some examples from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
